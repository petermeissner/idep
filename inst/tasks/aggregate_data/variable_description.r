    measures governenment control of the legislative agenda. 
     
The cross section values found in the table were assigned to those SO versions that were enacted in 1985 (when the agenda control measure was gathered).
To extrapolate the measure over time it was: 
1) multiplied by the number of words for those 1985 versions, 
2) the change in majority prone and minority prone words was added (majority words as positives, minority words as negatives)
3) these text lengths were again divided by the lengths of the 1985 versions.

Because it is unclear which numeric relation the agenda control measure and the change of pro majority / pro minority words might hold 
(one would need a second time point to determine that) the varaible exists in three variations: ext_tsb_agc1, ext_tsb_agc2 and ext_tsb_agc4.
The numbers indicate by which factor the change in majority/minority friendly words was multiplied to give it an higher impact (1, 2, 4) thus increasing the variance
of the agenda control extrapolation.
