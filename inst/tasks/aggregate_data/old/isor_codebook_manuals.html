<p>To collect data on reforms to Standing Orders many steps had to be taken and many hands had to help. The basic idea was that two proceeding versions of the same text can be compared by putting them side by side and going through each (sub)-paragraph:</p>

<p>To gather changes in that manner the first task is to <strong>acquire all the documents</strong> that describe the status or evolution of a particular set of Standing Orders. That step incorporated finding contact persons within the parliaments and checking for completeness and consistency of the provided ‘historical’ documents.</p>
<p>While intuitively one might think about Standing Orders as fully written out, explicit documents most of the time this is only but a little part of the story. While so called <strong>consolidated versions</strong> exist, most of the time one needs a consolidated version and all the amendments (short, technical instructions of how to transform Standing Orders in place to a new set of Standing Orders) made to that version over time to know which set of rules was in place at a certain point in time. To apply the basic idea all amendments had to be transformed into consolidated versions.</p>
<p>Documents were provided in differing form and in differing shades of quality. There might be sheets of paper, Books, Word-documents, machine readable PDFs or scans. All those various types were first transformed to Word-documents and later on freed of transformation errors and artifacts in a <strong>cleaning</strong> step.</p>
<p>After cleaning and consolidation <strong>documents were restructured</strong> in such a way that each sub-paragraph corresponded to one line in a plain text file. Furthermore, lines without relevant content such as headlines or notes were marked by <code>#§#</code>. The restructuring made it easy for the documents to be read in by the coding programs used in the following steps.</p>
<p>For comparing Standing Orders effectively we made use of two types of programs: First there are programs specialized in presenting the comparison of documents to humans. Second, there are programs that are less accessible by humans but more standardized and therefore better suited to serve as helpers for computer programs. While we found good companions in the first category – e.g. UltraCompare, the Notepad++ Compare Plugin, DiffDoc, WinMerge, … see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_comparison_tools" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_comparison_tools</a>, for a list) – we did not find any tool that suited our needs in the second category – i.e. indicating line modifications and measuring differences.</p>
<p>Therefore we wrote our <strong>own software</strong> that helped with comparing texts, assigning change types and measuring differences. Three programs were written: The frist for comparing documents, <strong>gathering links</strong> between sub-paragraph from one version to the other, assigning <strong>change types</strong> an measuring change; the second for coding changes between documents as <strong>minority or majority friendly</strong>; the third for coding sub-paragraphs into <strong>categories capturing the type of regulation</strong>.</p>
<p>The data gathered with help of the programs than was merged into one <strong>database</strong> with three tables - meta information on the Standing Orders (<em>texts</em>), the text of the Standing Orders and accompanied data (<em>textlines</em>) and how sub-paragraphs from one version are linked those of another version (<em>textlines</em>). Thereafter the information were <strong>checked for errors</strong>. After elimanting all errors the raw information from the database was then <strong>aggregated</strong> to various formats.</p>
</div>
<div id="document-transformation" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Document Transformation</h1>
<p>The original Standing Orders documents gathered often were books or came as scans in PDF format. To be able to further work with them the text had to be brought into computer readable format. This first digital format of the Standing Orders text was Word. Although, the texts later on were further broken down into plain text, Word is a good intermediate format since everyone is familiar with it and it is able to emulate the layout of the original document which eases comparisons between original and digital version.</p>

<div id="document-consolidation" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Document Consolidation</h1>
<p>In order to construct a data base consisting of all parliamentary standing orders that were in force at a specific point in time consolidated versions of the standing orders were needed. Consolidated versions are complete versions with all changes that had occurred at a specific date included in the body of the text.</p>
<p>However, there are often only few consolidated versions provided by national parliaments. Changes to the standing orders are most of the time published as amendments and only once in a while a full version of the current text is issued. As a consequence, consolidated versions of the standing orders for every date of change had to be constructed by inserting manually the changes into the previous complete version.</p>

</div>
<div id="document-cleaning" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Document Cleaning</h1>
<p>The aim of this procedure was to identify and correct errors that had occurred through the process of converting PDF-documents into Word-documents. Another purpose was to put the cleaned versions of the parliamentary standing orders in a standardized format while maintaining the original structure of paragraphs. First of all, the oldest consolidated version of Standing Orders was completely read through and corrected manually. Typos, unnecessary line breaks, signs not belonging to the text and everything going beyond the actual text of the standing orders was deleted.</p>
<p>Next, a header containing information about the version such as the dates of acceptance, promulgation and enactment of the version of the standing orders was inserted. The version cleaned in this manner served as reference version. In the following step the subsequent consolidated version was compared to the reference version using the software DiffDoc (in a later state of the cleaning process the software UltraCompare was used instead). The software made it possible to easily identify identical parts of the two versions that only contained few mistakes to be corrected as well as parts that had been changed. The latter were read completely and handled like the first version. After the cleaning of the second version it served as new reference version for the subsequent consolidated version of the standing orders. Alongside cleaning the text, it was made sure that each sub-paragraph, headline or other structuring element of the standing orders was given a single line. Each element was separated by a line break; no element was allowed to spread more than one line. The steps were repeated for all consolidated versions. Throughout the procedure the PDF-versions of the standing orders were considered in case of uncertainty regarding cleaning decisions. In a last step the lines (representing text elements) that were of non-relevant content (e.g. headlines) were marked by adding a special string at the start of the line (‘#§#’) to allow the computer to automatically dismiss these lines later on.</p>

<div id="description" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Description</h2>
<p>Having generated complete, cleaned versions of the standing orders, the next step was to further prepare the data so that the content of the standing orders could be coded in an efficient manner and to get information about what had or had not changed from one version to the next. For this purpose changes in the standing orders between versions were linked. This means that for each line of text (each relevant sub-paragraph) it was recorded whether or not the line was deleted in the version to come, got inserted in the current version, got changed or simply stayed the same. The coding was done semi-automatically by first letting an algorithm developed by the project and implemented in R handle all non-relevant lines as well as those that were not changed. Thereafter human coders went through all remaining text lines of two subsequent versions to add there linkage information to the data-set. For this another program implemented in R helped the coders by making sure that: all lines were coded; the information was recorded correct and alongside the text that was linked, coders were given suggestions for possible matching lines similar to that under consideration. As the linked files depicted the basis for later analyzes and coding, it was crucial to differentiate between minor reformulations of paragraphs (e.g. mere orthographic reforms) and actual changes. In case of doubt the supervisors were consulted.</p>
<p>The process of gathering link information between sub-paragraphs of subsequent standing orders versions allows for distinguishing between types of change (deletion, insertion, modification and no-change), measuring its extent more precisely and to later transfer line codes from one version of the standing orders to another so that all sub-paragraphs (the selected coding entity) that were identical in two versions got automatically the same code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the use of an semi-automatic approach allows to use the strengths of both computers and humans: computers are good at doing the same stuff over and over again in the same and predictable way - e.g. finding identical lines, computing measures of similarity, saving data always in the very same format – while humans on the other hand have a much better understanding of the content of text, might understand intentions of the text authors and are more creative and flexible – e.g. finding line pairs that might be not very similar based on the sequence of characters or the distribution of words but in regard to the things that are regulated within.</p>

<p>While software was used to help finding matches between versions was non-trivial. Coders were recruited on the basis that either they were native speakers or had a very high language proficiency. Good knowledge about the government system of the countries was a further requirement. In addition, coders had to undergo training:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, coders were informed about the purpose of their task, i.e.: Gathering information about changed and unchanged parts of Standing Orders to later on build determine the amount of change, as well as easing Corpus Coding and Minority/Majority-Coding later on.</li>
<li>Next, coders were asked to take some time to read the first and the last version available to get a feeling for the content, it’s structure, and the amount of change that happend between first and last version.</li>
<li>Than coders were introduced into DiffDoc and later on UltraCompare to view the whole documents side by side if needed.</li>
<li>Than coders got supervised training on the coding software for one to three reforms.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Training and Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>Coding the proness of changes to the parliamentary Standing Orders towards majority or minority is all but trivial. The original standing orders of national parliaments are usually only published in the language of the country. Thus, coders were recruited who were either native speakers or non-native speakers with very high language proficiency. Good knowledge about the government system of the countries was a further requirement. In addition, coders had to undergo an intensive training.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, coders were introduced to the concept of parliamentary minority and majority and how it differs from Government and other political bodies which are often closely connected but might not be the same – e.g. Governments often are dependent on a parliamentary majority that is supportive or at least tolerates Government but Government and parliamentary majority are not the same thing with agendas and personal of their own.</li>
<li>Next, coders were given one Standing Orders reform with the task to try to code on their own. Coders were asked to be careful and if in doubt to gather argumentations for why a coding might go in one direction or the other.</li>
<li>After having left the coder with this first reform. All coding decissions were discussed.</li>
<li>This process usually did not have to be repeated but was done so, if canonical solutions and individual coding decissions were to much apart.</li>
<li>After this formal training phase coders were asked to code all clear neither-nor cases themselves while they should come up with suggestions and reasoning for all non clear cases and changes that might be either minority or majority friendly.</li>
<li>For most of the time when a coder was working one of the two research assistants was present in the room. Asking questions was strongly and always encouraged.</li>
<li>After the coder did a batch of coding all non-clear cases were discussed by the coder and one of the research assistants and decided. If need be the project leader entered the discussion as well.</li>

<div id="corpus-coding" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Corpus Coding</h1>
<div id="description-2" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Description</h2>
<p>Based on the linked versions of the standing orders the content could be coded. The intention of the so called corpus coding process was to assign a single code expressing the content to every legal sub-paragraph of every version of the standing orders.</p>
<p>The coding scheme comprises 80 different single codes belonging to ten different categories (law-making, special decision procedures other than regular law-making, relationship to government, relationship to external offices/institutions apart from the government, generating publicity, internal organization of parliament, change and interpretation of the standing orders, general rules regarding formation and legislative session/discontinuity, final provisions, miscellaneous (cannot be coded otherwise)).</p>
<p>Apart from the codes the coding manual encompasses general rules for coding. As every sub-paragraph got only one code the coders had to decide which code suites best even if several different codes could be assigned to a sub-paragraph. These decisions were based on a specific hierarchy of codes. Rules which concern the interaction of two actors were attributed to the actor which takes the active part if he has discretion regarding this action. Regular law-making was considered more important than other decision procedures if they were treated together in one sub-paragraph. A further general coding rule was to take the overall context into account instead of just looking at a specific regulation.</p>
<p>Like the other coding processes corpus coding was done semi-automatically with a self-written program implemented in R. Human coders went through the oldest version of the standing orders and assigned the appropriate codes from the coding scheme to every text line to create one fully coded version. The next step was to transfer these codes to the other versions. As in the linking procedure text lines that have stayed exactly the same from one version to the following had been identified and linked, the R program automatically assigned the same codes to them. So the coders only had to go through the not coded text lines of the subsequent version of the standing orders (that is the passages that had been changed between two versions) and code them manually. Then, the new codes were transferred. The coders proceeded in this way until all versions of the standing orders were completely coded with regard to their content.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Training and Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>The original standing orders of national parliaments are usually only published in the language of the country. Thus, coders were recruited who were either native speakers or non-native speakers with very high language proficiency. Good knowledge about the government system of the countries was a further requirement. As corpus coding was a very demanding task, all coders got intensive training.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the coders familiarized themselves with the coding manual, the different categories and coding rules.</li>
<li>Next, the new coders practiced through joint coding with experienced coders.</li>
<li>After this, the coders coded the most recent version of the standing orders and compared their results to a master version. Usually the most recent versions of the standing orders are also issued in English. These versions had been coded by those responsible for the project and served as master versions.</li>
<li>On the condition that coders mastered this task they could start coding on their own.</li>
<li>Throughout the coding process ambiguities and problems were solved in joint discussion with the project coordinators.</li>
<li>If it was necessary, supplementary documents such as constitutions and information from the webpages of the national parliaments were considered to check coding decisions.</li>

<li>Note for UltraCompare: Converting the PDF documents to Word documents resulted in so-called “Bedingte Trennstriche” (soft hyphen). These are invisible in the Word documents, but UltraCompare recognizes them. You can delete these by using the “Suchen und Ersetzen” (find and replace) function: at the very bottom, select “Sonderformat” (special format) and then check the option “Bedingter Trennstrich” (soft hyphen). Then, you select the “Replace” option and replace this “Bedingter Trennstrich” with nothing (e.g. not even a space, just leave the line blank).</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Manual for Linking Standing Orders versions</h2>
<p><strong>Before linking the changes in R</strong>, the following steps have to be taken</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Save all cleaned versions as txt-files in “Geschäftsordnungen/Coding Changes/CountryFolder/TXT”</li>
<li>Make sure the naming of the TXT-files complies to the following scheme:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Country abbreviation</li>
<li>minus</li>
<li>year (4 digits)</li>
<li>underscore</li>
<li>month (2 digits)</li>
<li>underscore</li>
<li>day (2 digits)</li>
<li>if and only if there are two versions for the same date indicate them with:</li>
<li>underscore</li>
<li>letter (A, B, C, … for the first, second, … version on that date, make sure to use CAPITAL Letters)</li>
<li>Examples: “SWE-2002_09_23.txt”, “SWE-2003_01_01_A.txt”, “SWE-2003_01_01_B.txt”, …</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Put #§# (hash paragraph hash space) before all irrelevant lines (e.g. headlines, name of standing orders, date of going into force)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The intuition behind linking the changes</strong> is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The R-function recognizes automatically when two sub-paragraphs are absolutely identical - if this is the case, they are automatically coded as 100 (% identical)</li>
<li>All other sub-paragraphs are presented by the R-function for manual linking (this is even the case if there is just a space too much in either one of the sub-paragraphs)</li>
<li>Whether or not two sub-paragraphs belong together can be assessed best when comparing the versions one is linking in UltraCompare</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linking in R</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open R</li>
<li>Open Notepad</li>
<li>Execute one of the following functions
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Begin linking: “Coding Changes”</li>
<li>Continue linking: “Recode Changes”</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Comply with the prompts of the function
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Type in your name</li>
<li>Select the original documents (Geschäftsordnungen/Coding Changes/CountryFolder/TXT/txt-file)</li>
<li>Press enter</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Link non-identical sub-paragraphs (absolutely identical ones are linked automatically)
<ul>
<li>0: deletion/insertion of a sub-paragraph</li>
<li>1: change of a sub-paragraph</li>
<li>100: sub-paragraph is 100% identical</li>
<li>-99: line is irrelevant (this option should have become unnecessary through #§# )</li>
<li>-7: show next match</li>
<li>321: correct line number can be inserted directly (useful if the proposed lines do not include the correct line)</li>
<li>666: loop starts again</li>
<li>987: not sure how sub-paragraph should be coded</li>
<li>951: end coding –&gt; every subsequent sub-paragraph will be coded with 987 (if you choose to use this option, write down the last “real” 987 to allow you to continue coding at the right point the next time)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Linked as 100% identical (i.e. 100)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When original document says “in the article number 2” and the new version says “in the second article” (and vice versa)</li>
<li>When original document says “The commissions are: (and then a list of commissions)”, and the new version says “The commissions are the following: (and then a list of commissions)”</li>
<li>When original document says “The Parliament”, and the new version says “The National Parliament”, as long as it is clear they refer the same institution</li>
<li>When the difference between original and new version is:
<ul>
<li>A comma</li>
<li>A space in the middle or end of the sentence</li>
<li>A capital letter</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When the same article refers to a paragraph that has a different number (“according to article 1” in the original, and “according to the article 2” in the new version), but the content of them is the same</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linked as change (i.e. 1)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When the same article refers to a paragraph that has a different number (“according to article 1” in the original, and “according to the article 2” in the new version), but the content of these is not the same</li>
<li>When the same article refers to the same paragraph that has the same number (“according to article 1” in the original, and “according to article 1” in the new version), but the content of these (article 1) is not the same</li>
<li>When the article has changed</li>
<li>When part of the original article was deleted (original reads “There are 15 deputies in each commission as minimum, and they cannot exceed 30”, and the new version reads “There are 15 deputies in each commission as minimum”)</li>
<li>When the original document says “according to the President” and the new document says “according to the President of the Parliament” when the first one could also refer the President of a special commission</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Coding Scheme for Corpus Coding</h2>
<div id="basic-intuition" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.3.1</span> Basic Intuition:</h3>
<p>Each and every code is exclusive, meaning that one sub-paragraph needs to have one code but one code only. For some codes there are notes on how to decide between multiple codes which may seem appropriate. Sometimes even the coding rules and additional notes will not help to decide between codes. In this case please let us know. Every decision accompanied by doubt should be documented.</p>
</div>
<div id="further-rules-of-the-game" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.3.2</span> Further rules of the game:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Often sub-paragraphs can be coded differently, depending on whether or not one takes into consideration the overall context of the rule or the more specific regulation. If in doubt, code based on the overall context. Example: §14 GOBT: president grants vacation time → coded as rights and obligations of individual members of parliament if one takes into account the general context (652) and not as responsibility of the president (6212).</p></li>
<li><p>Rules which concern the interaction of two actors are attributed to the actor which takes the active part if he has discretion regarding this action. Example: §62 (2) GOBT: The plenary can request report of committee → coded as recall through the plenary (124) and not as report of committee to the plenary (134).</p></li>
<li><p>The right of those initiating a bill or law to be present at the committee meetings is coded as general right of individual members of parliament (652).</p></li>
