# The reforms dataset (version 1.27)
The data-set is based on the IDEP data - data on Standing Orders versions (*texts*), data on Standing Orders Text (*textlines*) and data on Standing Orders change between versions (*linelinkage*). Information from all three sources are aggregated on Standing Orders version level - i.e. each version has its own line in the data-set. This aggregation allows for studying what happened - in an aggregate - at each reform of Standing Orders. 

The data set incorporates aggregated data for 
770 reforms in
15 countries and consists of 
225 variables. 

**Example:**


```r
reforms  %>% 
  select(t_id, wds_clean_rel, wds_chg, pro_min, pro_maj, wds_corp_agg_1)
```

```

# Shortcuts 

**SP** is short for subparagraph and in most cases identical to **line** or text line due to the fact that sub-paragraphs have in the data gathering process been transfered (from PDFs and Word documents and the like) to simple text files in which each sub-paragraph was put on a single line and on one single line only.

**SO** is short for Standing Orders (rules of procedure) and usually refers to one particular version of Standing Orders in force in a particular country from a particular time point on. 



# General variable name shortcuts

**wds** is short for words, like the number of words within a SP. 

**lns** is short for lines an equivalent to SP. 

**rel** is short for relevant, like whether or not a SP contains relevant information or can be  dismissed as headline, blank-line, comment, appendix or some other not relevant part of the text (the opposite usually is **all**)

**raw** versus **clean** denote whether or not the SP was used as found in the official documents or cleaned up. Cleaned SPs have been stripped by their enumeration (only at the start of the SP), thus pure changes of enumeration (only at the start of the SP) are not considered as changes nor are they counted as relevant content. 

**ins**, **del**, **mdf**, **non**: denote the type of change that occurred for a particular SP - insertion, deletion, modification and no-change. The shorthand **chg** is for change and refers to all three possible forms that change might come by. 

**pro_...** indicate minority/majority codings, e.g. *pro_min* indicates how many SPs were changed in a way considered minority friendly. 


# Shortcuts indicating their raw data sets 

**db_** and **int_** denote variables that have to do with the database that serves as basis for all data-sets and are most likely not relevant to the user. 

**t_** information on text or Standing Orders version level, e.g. the data when a particular standing order was accepted, the country it belongs to or total number of words of the  version, ... .

**tl_** information on text lines aka SPs, e.g whether or not a SP is relevant, how many words it contains, it's corpus code, ... .


**ll_** information on the what happened to SPs from one version to the next - e.g. was it changed or deleted. 

Other shortcuts or variable names missing the above mentioned shortcuts indicate that those variables have been computed from other variables and most likely were result from some form of aggregation. See below for more detailed descriptions.

# Appendix


## Coding Manual: Categories and Codes for Coding the Content of Parliamentary Standing Orders

### Basic Intuition:

Each and every code is exclusive, meaning that one subparagraph needs to have one code but one code only. For some codes there are notes on how to decide between multiple codes which may seem appropriate. Sometimes even the coding rules and additional notes will not help to decide between codes. In this case please let us know. Every decision accompanied by doubt should be documented.

### Further rules of the game:

-	Often sub-paragraphs can be coded differently, depending on whether or not one takes into consideration the overall context of the rule or the more specific regulation. If in doubt, code based on the overall context. Example: 14 GOBT: president grants vacation time &#8594; coded as rights and obligations of individual members of parliament if one takes into account the general context (652) and not as responsibility of the president (6212).

-	Rules which concern the interaction of two actors are attributed to the actor which takes the active part if he has discretion regarding this action. Example: 62 (2) GOBT: The plenary can request report of committee &#8594; coded as recall through the plenary (124) and not as report of committee to the plenary (134).

-	The right of those initiating a bill or law to be present at the committee meetings is coded as general right of individual members of parliament (652).



### Coding Scheme

**(1) Law Making**

&nbsp;

*Note: SPs that refer to both the plenary sessions and committees are coded as 12x; SPs dealing with both law-making and special decision procedures are coded as 1xx.*


* **11 Bills and Motions**
    + 111	types of bills and motions; printing and distribution of bills and motions to MPs
    + 112	right to initiate bills and motions 
    + 113	restrictions and deadlines (if not assignable to more specific category, e.g. code 121; 32; 134)
    + 114	legislative planning (concerns the whole term- general schedule)
* **12	Treatment of bills and motions in the plenary** *(Note: SPs including all stages of the treatment of bills and motions are coded as votes in the plenary (123); SPs which determine the subject of debate and vote are coded as subject of vote (123).)*
    + 121	debate in the plenary
    + 122	right of amendment in the plenary 
    + 123	subject of vote, rules of vote (including quorum), voting technology in the plenary

    + 125	referral to committee, withdrawal from committee
* **13	Treatment of bills and motions in committee** *(Note: SPs including all stages of the treatment of bills and motions in committee are coded as votes in committee (133); SPs which determine both the subject of debate and the subject of vote are coded as subject of vote in committee (133).)*
